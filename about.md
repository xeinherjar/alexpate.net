I'm currently a student at the Iron Yard in Atlanta participating in the Front End Engineering course.

Prior to this, I was a system administrator at a [small software company](http://docauto.com) in Norcross, GA, where we built software for managing and interacting with WorkSite, a DMS now owned by HP.

I'm into craft beer, cooking, curing and smoking meats and getting my passport stamped.
