## Nixel
Nixel is a NES sprite editor.  It allows you to load a NES ROM and edit the sprite data, you can then patch the changes to the ROM and play with your new sprites.  For example you could remove Mario's mustache or add your sigil to Link's shield.

## Chip-8 Emulator
This is a Chip-8 emulator.  I'm very interested in VMs and emulators and this was recommended to me as a great starting place.
There may be a few small bugs here and there, I only spent two short days on it.
